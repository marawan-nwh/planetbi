## Tasks

- Authentication handlers and pages
  - If we moved from a page to page (from signin to verify for example), does it carry the CSS with it?
  - Rate limiter
  - Consistent CSS classes and shared CSS would be nice
  - Create tests for all auth endpoints and all cenarios
  - Auth pages should redirect to homepage if user is already signed in
  - Review all auth endpoint
- Homepage
- Account page (view, edit, delete account)
- Create view and viewlist
- Add terms and conditions, and check the link in the signup page
- Email sending needs more testing (could this be because it is in sandbox now?)
