## Ideas

- Dependencies
  Let the user add URLs of JS libs to views, viewsets or dashboards, and we inject them into the page so they can be used in the views.
  This will enable the user to do a lot of things that we didn't add or won't add.
- Add a setting to the workspace to lock all views to use text or tables only
- Add the ability to add two views in the same view if we gonna add charts, one for the charrt and one for the table
- Take inspiration to the homepage style from Hex's homepage. Add starred and recent table at the top, and then all at the bottom
- Add the ability to arrange items in the homepage
- Drag and drop items into collections and (starred, archive)
- Dashboard pages (and not just for the whole dashboard, but add the ability to add section in the dashboard that the section itself could have pages)
- Saved functions (let's say there is an perparation and transformation step the developer does many times, why he should replicate the code in all the views?)

## Notes

- Authorization in Looker Studio is broken and boring, but in theory having that many connections and reports is powerful addition.
- Looking into this https://www.sisense.com/solutions/finance for example, it looks like reports of this kind are not for PlanetBI. (but could we add and fit them later?)
